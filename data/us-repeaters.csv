The repeater first went online in 1970. In 2000, the current repeater was purchased from the Iowa Department of Transportation. The repeater was located at the Iowa State Patrol Tower on the west side of Denison, IA on IA-59 North, with an antenna located at 250 feet. The Iowa State Patrol was gracious enough to provide the tower space and a building to house the repeater for years. In 2011 the Denison Repeater was taken offline and moved to a temporary location at the home QTH of KD0E, as the Iowa Department of Safety needed more tower space for their own equipment as they upgraded. In November 2013, the repeater finally found itself a new home located on a public safety tower just north of Denison, IA with current antenna at 150 feet. </i> <br> <br> <b> <mark> On Friday 05 January 2024, an email from KB0PRL -- BYRON J.

In addition, similar odd-channel repeater pairings in the 146–148 MHz range are inconsistent with the established coordination standards, which have remained unchanged since the 1990s.  These standards are based on 5 kHz FM deviation spacing, and deviations from them can result in spectral overlap and interference concerns.  This listing reflects a repeater configuration with a 145.200 MHz output and a 144.600 MHz input, which falls outside the historically coordinated channel structure for this band.

This tells the C-Bridge that someone is listening to this talkgroup, and the C-Bridge will then route it to the repeater.  The “Local” talkgroup, TG9, is not routed through the C-Bridge. TG9 on TS2 is a preferred way for locals to talk on a given a repeater and not have it routed to other repeaters. We would highly suggest you program this in your radio, as some features may be added to link it to the 147.12 repeater when the net mode is active (this will come at a later date)",2021-05-15
